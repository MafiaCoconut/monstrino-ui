When I was a kid, I imagined becoming a glamorous and beloved performer. I mean, I knew I had the hair for it. As I grew up, I embraced a sense of self-expression. When others went simple, I went big. And when they went safe, I went spooky. That’s how I made my mark. My act was always a little over-the-top, a little outside the lines, and a little mysterious. And that’s what made it…me. I’ve got a few pointers for anyone who wants to give it a try.\r\n\r\n1. Dazzle. The camera (and everyone else) is watching. Long lashes, high contrast, shimmering shadows. Can’t lose.\r\n\r\n2. Be someone your supernatural self would root for. Be bold. Be weird. Be you. What else is there?\r\n\r\n3. Make an entrance they won’t dare to forget. With a spider-printed cape and a little shock of purple, nightmares really walk among us.",
